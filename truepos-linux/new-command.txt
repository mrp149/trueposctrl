 NEW COMMAND LIST

 Based on FW 12.0.1      $Revision: 1.4 $ on $Date: 2022/11/01 20:46:03 $ UTC


---- Commands:

 $PROCEED           [Send at startup to get past the bootloader]

 $FACT              [Factory preset]

---- Get commands:

 $GETBDELAY         [Returns board delay, nanoseconds]
 $GETDELAY          [Returns cable delay, nanoseconds]
 $GETPOS            [Returns position]
 $GETSCALEFACTOR    [Returns a float, such as 3.742106e-3. Value is crystal's gain in Hz/mV.]
 $GETVER            [Returns version info]

---- Other unknown get commands:

 $GETA                 [Returns -1; Attenuator?]
 $GETP              [Returns -1 255; Potentiometer?]


---- Set commands:

 $KALDBG <0|1>      [Enable reporting of Kalman filter parameters]

 $PPSDBG <0|1>      [Enable or disable timing information every second]

 $RESET             [Unit software reset]

 $SETBDELAY <n>     [-32 <= n <= 32, Set board delay, PPS4 units (roughly 5 or 6 ns). PPS4 is controlled to equal this value]

 $SETDELAY <n>      [-9999 <= n <= +9999 Set cable delay, 0.1us unit (100ns)]

 $SETPOS <n> <n> <n> [set position to Lat/Long/Elevation_MSL, send value returned by survey]

 $SURVEY <n>        [survey for n hours, default is 8, 1<=n<=49]

 $TRAINOXCO         [Start OXCO Training. This restarts the board ($PROCEED needed), and measures freq
                change with 500 ADC count. See result with $GETSCALINGFACTOR.]
                this executes $FACT command.

 $SET1PPS x y       This formats GPrrs message for Furuno - $PFEC,GPrrs,x,100,y
                x - 0 = traim off, 1 = traim on
                y - 0-nopps output, 1-always output pps, 2-output in ordinary way, 3 - output only when sufficient satellites are tracked
                Internally they use "$SET1PPS 1 1" and "$SET1PPS 1 3"

 $SETGAIN <n>       [Sets gain Parameter, n is integer, in hundreths. Maybe a multiplication factor for the DAC adjustment.]

 $ESN xxx           programs serial number to xxx

 $REPORT [x [y [z]]]  set reporting time (optional)
                x - time report period (in sec), this controls $CLOCK message
                y - sat report (on/off), control sending of $SAT, $WSAT
                z - state report period (in sec), $STATUS and $EXTSTATUS
                reports all SAT and WSAT messages stored in mcu if reporting enabled

 $SETINTG num       Sets integrator ?

 $SETOFFSET num     Sets DAC offset - this is not persistent, and will not survive reboot

 $SPIW num          Writes num into DAC - manual osc tunning ? (probably needs manual holdover)

 $FxRxxH            Toggle forced holdover
                if state == 0 set state = 4
                else if state == 4 set state = 20.

 $FxRxxU            Get leap second from config saved in flash, when no leap second from GPS is available

 $JAM               Jam sync - whatever that means

 ---- Messages to communicate with GPS receiver:

 $EBG *             Copy all messages from GPS port to communication port (0 to turn off)

 $Fxxx              Sends nmea message to GPS
                xxx needs to start with $ (eg: $F$PFEC....)

 $ELOAD             GPS firmware loading ... dont bother
 $AGP               APGS load

 ---- Other debug commands:

 $EBG x             Engine debug 0 = disable *=all?
 $XBG x             Console clone (whatever that is)
 $RBG x             Raw debug
 $CBG x             Command debug
                last 3 debugs are only for jtag uart, they dont change output for comm port

---- Unknown commands:

 $TRAIM x -         Disables traim evaluation in gpsdo? 0 - skips some computation internally
                Note: TRAIM works when fixed viewpoint mode is selected. When TRAIM is set in fixed viewpoint mode with a valid position
                entered, TRAIM operates with 2 satellites that can be used to calculate the position. Two of these satellites are
                available, and the receiver can generate an alarm if an abnormality is detected on any of these satellites. When 3 or
                more satellites are available, the receiver can isolate the anomalous satellite and exclude it from the position
                calculation.

---- Response Messages:

 $PPSDBG 1187153266 3 25.28081e3 -253 -6 2 2 0.0
 $PPSDBG 2 0.0 [Fewer parmaters when in holdover?]
 1: Same as clock (GPS Time)  FURUNO does not back up date after Sept. 2022, in the conversion only GPS time is reliable.
 2: Same as $STATUS status, but updates much more often (and seems to skip states less often)
 3: Floating point number. DAC set value. Tends towards 29e3 on my board. Proportional to the DAC voltage
        On my RevC CTS board, Vbias ~= 6.25e-5*PPS3. This may make sense for a 4.096 V reference: 4.096/2^16=6.25e-5
        During startup, it is not put in the result string (this field is blank, so two sequential space characters are in the string)
 4: Measured phase offset? Units seem something like 6.5*ns
 5: PPS offset from $PFEC,GPrrm message - range from -15 to +14
 6: PPS status from $PFEC,GPrrm message
 7: TRAIM status from $PFEC,GPrrm message
 8: Always 0.0 - temperature on 12.1.1 firmware

 $EXTSTATUS  0 1 01.00 38.40
 1: SurveyStatus [0=normal, 1=surveying]
 2: Number of sats used for positioning, copied from $GPGGA message
 3: HDOP if 2Dfix, PDOP if 3D fix, copied from $GPGGA message
 4: Temperature (close to FPGA? close to oven?) (my board reads about 45C)
 5: GPS discard counter - error related ?

 $GETPOS (sent after setting position, or requesting position
 1: Latitude
 2: Longitude
 3: Elevation_MSL
 4: Correction to MSL to get WGS elevation (add this value to MSL to get WGS ellipsoid)
 5: Traim status from GPS. From Furuno GPrrm msg: 
                      0 = possible to detect and remove abnormalities
                      1 = possible to detect
                      2 = not possible to detect

 $SURVEY 40448488 -86915296 225 -34 7129
 [sent during a survey]
 1: Latitude
 2: Longitude
 3: Elevation_MSL
 4: Correction to MSL to get WGS elevation (add this value to MSL to get WGS ellipsoid)
 5: Number of seconds remaining

 $SAT 2 30 41 288 28
 1: Channel # (0-based, seems to only return channel 0 through 7)
 2: GPS Sattelite number
 3: Elevation (degree)
 4: Azimuth (degree)
 5: SNR (dB*Hz)

 $CLOCK 1187156731 18 3
 1: GPS UNIX-timestamp (secs since 1970), but my board is off by 10 years (reporting 2007 while it is 2017)
 2: Count of leap-seconds
 3: Time figure-of-merit (1=good, 7=bad)

 $GETVER 12.0.1 BOOT 10 fbde 7437 06162200B0000A2004183ACC
 $GETVER 12.0.1 0.4850266.0.1 19 fbde 7437 06162200B0000A2004183ACC
 [version information, I used this to know if I need to send the PROCEED command, String contains BOOT when in bootloader mode]
 [During boot, only terminated with LF but not CR(or maybe other-way around?)]
 1: Bootloader version?
 2: ("BOOT" during boot) or (software or perhaps GPS version info????)
 3: Status code (same as $STATUS)
 4: CRC of something?
 5: Always 7437?
 6: (Part number: 06162200)(Board Rev: B)(Assembly version: 0000)(Delimeter: A)(Year: 2004)(Week?: 18)(SN?: 3ACC)

 $WSAT 4 138 209 38 0
 [WAAS Satellite info, same format as $SAT]

 $SET1PPS
 [Sent at boot, but also in response to a $SET1PPS command. Sent every 20 seconds.]

 $SETGAIN 1.00
 [Sent is response to $SETGAIN <n> command]
 1: Value of gain. This should be n/100, and is a float.

 [Only be sent when reference is locked (state=0)]
 1: GPS UNIX-timestamp (secs since 1970), but my board is off by 10 years (reporting 2007 while it is 2017)
 2: Floating point number.
     Resets to 0 at time of lock (and at end of holdover).
 3: Floating point number. Magnitude is similar to PPS3, but does not track it so well.
 4: Floating point.
     Resets to 0 at time of lock (and at end of holdover).
 5: Floating point. Smoothed version of PPS3, seems like ~6.5*(PPS phase in ns)?
     Resets to 0 at time of lock (and at end of holdover).
 6: Always zero
 7: Always zero
