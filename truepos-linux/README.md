# truepos-linux

This work is based on the original Stm32 https://github.com/pigrew/trueposctrl
and the contibution from https://github.com/robots/trueposctrl.

The main purpose of truepos-linux is to provide fast access to GPS-DO equipment for calibration of your 10 MHz standards references. 

This is required if you are dependent on the 10 MHz reference frequency in your home or amateur radio station and
have Trueposition GPS-DO and Linux.

Just connect GPS-DO to Linux via serial port and go! It's always hard to decide what the GPSDO reference frequency
is right now, right? This program will help you make the right decision.

Currently, it mostly works.
